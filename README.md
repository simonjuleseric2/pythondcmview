# pythondcmview

(Work in progress)

This is an exemple for importing PET images and associated RTstructures, if you are interested in CT or MRI you need to change the UID_t and RS_UID in the StartWindow class (lines 23-24).

The CT images can also be displayed on a jupyter notebook using the notebook_display.ipynd.
